#Time Series Prediction of Monthly Electricity Consumption using RNN (LSTM)

##📌 Overview

In this project, I built a time-series forecasting model to predict monthly electricity consumption using a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). Since electricity usage depends on historical patterns, I used sequence-based deep learning instead of traditional regression models.# TS-Forcasting-of-Electricity-amount
